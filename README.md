## Description
Final goal of my thesis is to build an whole pipeline for the deep learning model focussed around Document Image Classification. 

<b>Steps to follow</b>
1. Build and train model for Document Image Classification task
2. Deploy Model( Either to create an API or to build a backend)
3. Set Up MLOPS
4. Create Frontend to showcase results
5. Write master's thesis
