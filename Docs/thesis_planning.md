# TODOs and logs

Start Date - 9th November 2022
- [X] Create directory structure for thesis code repo
- [X] Data Exploration Tobacco dataset eg no. of samples for each class
- [X] Create Train and Test folders for Tobacco2482 Dataset
- [X] Create a subset of tobacco dataset
- [X] Create custom loader for tobacco dataset
- [X] Create the folder structure for the python scripts

13th November 2022
- [X] Generate 10 sets of randomly shuffled dataset for Tobacco dataset ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- [ ] Understand transformer architecture
- [ ] Replicate the Vanilla transformer architecture
- [ ] Learn model deployment part
- [ ] Complete literature review for Document Image Classification
- [ ] Complete Deep Learning using Pytorch Books **(working on it currently 663/1187)** ![](https://geps.dev/progress/55)
- [ ] Code refactoring
- [ ] Research 2d Image enhancement techniques

15th November 2022
- [X] Merge load_checkpoint functionality
- [ ] Get Knowledge on Natural language Processing

15th November 2022
- [ ] Dig more into topic Class-Balanced Loss Based on Effective Number of Samples eg https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05555 find more papers and methods to do so
- [X] Dig more into metrices for classification loss eg BCE, cross entropy

21st November 2022
- [ ] Explore Rich
- [ ] Implement it into existing code
- [X] Explore Rich
- [X] Implement it into existing code

23rd Novamber 2022
- [ ] Create a normalizer function to get the statistic of the dataset (computing channel statistics)
- [ ] Learning late test to get the best learning rate
- [ ] Sceduler do more research into that
- [ ] Transfer Learning and Pre trained model
- [ ] Do more reaserch into that find the best working pre trained model (self supervised pretrained model)
- [ ] Start Documenting stuff
- [ ] More reaserch on optimizer in deep learning or optiminzer survey eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TudQZtgpoHk

28th November 2022
- [ ] Look into [this](https://github.com/IgorSusmelj/pytorch-styleguide#recommended-code-structure-for-training-your-model) pytorch style guide and follow it in your code.
